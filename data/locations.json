      "description": "The Talus Balls are infamous for being expensive ($600 000), ugly, and being placed in an odd location. Although most Edmontonians hate this work of public art, it\u2019s worth checking out at least once. Some kids climb on top of them, which may get you in trouble, IDK. It\u2019s also possible to crawl to the inside of the balls (unless the hole has been filled in recently), also not advisable. It\u2019s worth it to check out the balls if you are exploring the Whitemud Half-Circles or underneath the Quesnell bridge too. Park underneath the Quesnell on Fort Edmonton Park Road in the little side area.",
